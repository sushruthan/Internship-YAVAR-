How to install golang, vscode and set environment variables in linux

How to install Golang and set up GOPATH

1.Download Go binary

download go binary from official website

--https://golang.org/dl/

2.Extracting the download file and set up Go tree

Run the following command to remove previous installation at /usr/local/go, if any. Also back up any data before, if needed.
(run the command in root)

$sudo -i   ~to enter root

$rm -rf /usr/local/go 

Extract the archive you downloaded into /usr/local and create a Go tree in /usr/local/go by run the following code in root or using sudo  

$sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz

All the binaries are extracted to /home/usr/local directory.

You can verify the files in the /home/usr/local directory by running the command

$cd /home/usr/local

3.Create workspace in go


A workspace in Go will typically contain three folders:

    src – Contains Go source code files resides (includes 3rd party fetched packages)
    bin – Hosts all the command binaries generated as result of compilation
    pkg – Lists all package objects created from source files
    
create a folder with bin,pkg and src.

$mkdir myproject

$cd /myproject/

$mkdir bin pkg src 

$pwd  (to see the path)


4.set up PATH variable and GOPATH 

Run the command to temprorialy setup path variable

$export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

To verify the installation run the following command

$ go version


Set path and gopath globaly

To Set the environment variables to your shell path save the path in /.profile file or /.bashrc file.

$sudo nano $HOME/.profile # or $HOME/.bashrc

save the below line at end of the file.

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
export GOPATH=/home/sush/myproject
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN


Note: Changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer. To apply the changes immediately, just run the shell commands 

$source $HOME/.profile

in case of basrc, restart the terminal






bash_profile is executed for login shells, while . bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells. When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the machine, or remotely via ssh: . bash_profile is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt.
