Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. The same concept applies in programming languages as well. If a program allows to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive function call. Take a look at the following example âˆ’

func recursion() {
   recursion() /* function calls itself */
}
func main() {
   recursion()
}

Type conversion
 is a way to convert a variable from one data type to another data type. For example, if you want to store a long value into a simple integer then you can type cast long to int. You can convert values from one type to another using the cast operator
